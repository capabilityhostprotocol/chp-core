# CHP Protocol Changelog

Protocol- and schema-level changes only (implementation changes live in package
release notes). Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Every entry that changes canonical bytes or wire behavior names its regression
gate.

## [0.2.2] — additive over 0.2.1 — **released 2026-07-09**

### Added
- **Adapter provenance** (chp-v0.2.md §9, [proposals/0001](proposals/0001-adapter-provenance.md)
  → shipped): publisher-signed `adapter-provenance` statements over
  `{kind, package, version, wheel_sha256, created_at, canonicalization}`;
  install-time verification gate (hash-before-execute, refusal as the reserved
  `host_adapter_install_rejected` event); publisher trust via explicit
  pin/domain-anchor or per-package TOFU. New reserved family
  `SUPPLY_CHAIN_EVIDENCE_TYPES`. *Vector: `test-vectors/adapter-provenance.json`
  (both implementations + `verify.mjs`); guard `provenance_vector_verifies`.
  Refinement vs the proposal: `record_sha256` stays evidence-side (pip rewrites
  RECORD at install).*

## [0.2.1] — additive over 0.2 — **released 2026-07-09**

### Added
- **Deferred execution rides the submitting correlation** (chp-v0.2.md §7,
  pipeline doc §1): a background job / queued task MUST propagate the
  submitting invocation's correlation with a causal edge (`causation_id` =
  submitting `invocation_id`) — the gates ran at submit, so the execution's
  evidence must remain reachable from it. *Gate: jobs-adapter continuity test.*
- **Federated replay is never silently partial** (chp-http-binding.md §4b):
  a gateway `/replay` that could not reach every member MUST set
  `partial: true` + `missing_hosts` on the `ReplayResult` (schema gains the
  two optional fields — additive; single-host results unchanged).
- `/metrics` MAY expose integrity counters (`chp_verify_requests_total{valid}`,
  `chp_chain_breaks_total`) — verification failures become alertable.
- **Key custody** (chp-v0.2.md §3): a deployment SHOULD provision a distinct
  signing key per `host_id` (shared custody collapses per-host attribution to
  the key holder). Reference impl: per-host key-dir resolution, legacy fallback.
- **Adapter namespace reserved** (governance §5, reserved-names): `chp.adapters.*`
  with the `chp.adapters.<adapter>.<capability>` structure, the `chp.adapters`
  entry-point group, and the `chp-adapter-<name>` package convention.
- **Declared emits is a contract** (governance §4.4): a capability MUST NOT
  emit an event type that is neither declared, lifecycle, nor reverse-DNS
  namespaced. *Gate: adapter-conformance `undeclared_emit` static check (found
  and fixed real drift in two reference adapters on first sweep).*
- **Capability version semantics** (chp-v0.1.md §3, clarification): semver;
  same-major = compatible.
- Adapter-install provenance floor: the reference install path fingerprints
  the installed distribution (`record_sha256`) and appends
  `host_adapter_installed` evidence under the SUBMITTING correlation (per the
  deferred-execution rule). Signed provenance: [proposals/0001](proposals/0001-adapter-provenance.md).
- **Aggregator signatures** (chp-v0.2.md §8, the `aggregated` layer): the
  assembling gateway MAY sign the canonical task-bundle header — re-assembly
  breaks the signature even with a recomputed `task_root_hash`. Omit-when-empty:
  unsigned task bundles byte-identical. *Vector:
  `test-vectors/task-bundle-aggregated.json` (both implementations +
  `verify.mjs`); guard `aggregated_task_bundle_vector_verifies`.*
- **Participation manifests** (chp-v0.2.md §8): reserved
  `task_participants_declared` event (`FEDERATION_EVIDENCE_TYPES`) — a declared
  member set makes leaf omission detectable; the completeness limit now covers
  only *undeclared* leaves. Verification gains the `participation` check
  (absent manifest → no check, visibly).
- **Caller-key rotation** (binding §2): a caller name MAY carry several keys
  simultaneously — rotation is add-new → drain → remove-old, no auth gap.
- **Capability-scoped caller keys** (binding §2): `name:key:scope1|scope2`
  (exact id or trailing-`*` prefix); an out-of-scope invocation is a PROCESSED
  `policy_blocked` denial — HTTP 200 with evidence, never a transport 403.
  *Wire conformance grows 16→17 (`capability-scoped caller key`); both
  reference implementations pass 17/17.*

## [0.2] — additive over 0.1 — **released 2026-07-06**

### Added
- **Cross-host ordering `chp-causal-order-v1`** (chp-v0.2.md §7): deterministic
  causal topological ordering for a correlation's events across N hosts —
  closes v0.1 §10's "does not define cross-host total ordering". Vector:
  `test-vectors/ordering.json`. *Behavioral note: the gateway's federated
  `/replay` output order changed from wall-clock sort to causal order.*
- **Task bundles** (chp-v0.2.md §8): the cross-host verification unit —
  per-host signed bundles aggregated byte-untouched with a canonical member
  order and a `task_root_hash` fingerprint; verification includes causal
  closure + acyclicity; completeness limit stated normatively. Vector:
  `test-vectors/task-bundle.json`; schema `task-bundle.schema.json`.
- **`GET /export/{correlation_id}`** (http-binding §4a): single-host signed
  bundle export; on a gateway, the assembled task bundle (503 on partial —
  never silently-partial evidence). Gateway `/verify` upgraded to federated
  task-bundle verification (`mode: "federated"`), note-fallback retained.
- Correlation-context clarifications (§7): `trace_id` optional/W3C-aligned,
  `baggage` reserved, `parent_correlation_id` informative session-threading.
- **Evidence integrity tiers** (`none` / `hash-chain` / `signed`) with per-event
  `content_hash`/`prev_hash` chains and ed25519-signed bundles; signature covers
  the canonical bundle *header*, not just `root_hash` (chp-v0.2.md §1–3).
- **`chp-stable-v1` canonicalization**, byte-specified with published test
  vectors and a stdlib Node reference verifier (`test-vectors/verify.mjs`) —
  cross-language interop is vector-proven.
- **Governance vocabulary** (chp-governance-v0.2.md): reserved denial-code
  registry, risk-tier semantics/ordering, autonomy/approval/safety/incident/
  compliance/identity event families, reverse-DNS extension namespacing.
- **Normative invocation pipeline** (chp-invocation-pipeline.md): the 10-gate
  ordering + per-code trigger predicates (`capability_disabled` → `skipped`;
  `action_limit` counts only `execution_started`).
- **HTTP wire binding** (chp-http-binding.md): route table, `X-CHP-Key`
  constant-time auth, the load-bearing "processed invocation → HTTP 200,
  outcome in body" rule, conformance fixture profile.
- **Host-identity attestation + authenticated subject**: self-signed
  `host_id ↔ public_key` binding with validity windows; verified callers
  override client-asserted subjects.
- **Anchors** (chp-v0.2.md §3.1): external trust roots inside the signed
  attestation claim — `domain` (Web-PKI via `/.well-known/chp-identity`) and
  `did` (Radicle did:key SSHSIG countersignature). Omit-when-empty byte rule
  keeps pre-anchor bundles byte-identical.
- **Key lifecycle** (chp-v0.2.md §3.2): archival, chained rotation with
  continuity statements, self-signed revocation, `IDENTITY_EVIDENCE_TYPES`
  host-self events (the host's chain as its key-transparency log).
- Wire conformance suite: 15 black-box checks incl. the four governance gates
  and the identity document.

### Changed
- **chp-stable-v1 forbids non-integer numbers in canonicalized content**
  (chp-v0.2.md §2 rule 6). Rationale: Python `json.dumps(0.0)` and ECMAScript
  `String(0.0)` produce different bytes — a latent cross-language verification
  break for any governed bundle carrying a safety score. Fractional values are
  string-encoded in hashed payloads. *Gate: all pre-existing vectors unchanged;
  `governance-bundle.json` added as the governed-chain proof.*
- Host descriptor may advertise `protocol_version "0.2"` when serving the v0.2
  surface (schema relaxed from `const "0.1"` to an enum; a bare v0.1 host still
  advertises `"0.1"`).

### Compatibility
- All v0.2 features are **additive**: a v0.1-only host remains conformant at
  the `none` tier. Byte-compat regression gate: `test-vectors/signed-bundle.json`
  must verify unchanged under `verify.mjs` after any canonicalization-adjacent
  change.

## [0.1] — 2026-05/06 — **stable 2026-07-06**

Initial draft: capability/host descriptors, invocation envelopes, execution
evidence, correlation requirements, replay semantics, outcome model
(`success`/`failure`/`denied`/`skipped`), denial semantics, the 9 conformance
MUSTs, and 28 JSON Schemas.
